## Summarize Data 
```{r, warning = FALSE}
# Load the training data
trainingset <- read.csv("datatraining.txt", header = TRUE)

# Load the two sets of testing data
testset1 <- read.csv("datatest.txt", header = TRUE)
testset2 <- read.csv("datatest2.txt", header = TRUE)

# Look at the dimensions of the training data
dim(trainingset)

# Look at the class of each variable
sapply(trainingset, class)

# Convert the Occupancy variable into a factor
trainingset$Occupancy <- as.factor(trainingset$Occupancy)
testset1$Occupancy <- as.factor(testset1$Occupancy)
testset2$Occupancy <- as.factor(testset2$Occupancy)

# Get a summary of the data
summary(trainingset)
```
After looking at the distribution of occupancy, it looks like the occupancy is majority '0'. So 
the data is skewed, this is where k-fold testing becomes very crucial
